Audio Set Ontology License Information
--------------------------------------

The file [ontology.json](ontology.json) contains a subset of the
the [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/) ontology, a hierarchical
set of audio event classes.

Changes:
- The original ontology was modified to remove all classes that are not
  present in the [Yamnet list of classes](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/audioset/yamnet/yamnet_class_map.csv)
- The data was augmented with some derived `_meta` fields:
    - `_meta.abstract` - not in yamnet list but has descendants that are
    - `_meta.child_ids` - subset of child_ids that are in yamnet list (or have descendants that are)
    - `_meta.tags` - list of ids of classes that have this class as an ancestor
